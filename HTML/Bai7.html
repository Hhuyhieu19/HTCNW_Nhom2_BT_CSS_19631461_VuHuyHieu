            <p>Russia has used its veto at
                the UN to block a draft 
                international tribunal into
                the MH17 air disaster in
                July 2014. It was the only
                nation at the 15 - member 
                UN Security Council to 
                oppose the move,
                triggering widespread
                condemnation.</p>
            
            <p>The Malay sian Airlines 
                flight from Amsterdam to 
                Kuala Lumpur crashed in 
                eastern Ukraine, killing all
                298 people on borad, Pro-Russian
                rebels in the area 
                have denied shooting 
                down the aircraft. 
                Western nations and Ukraine say 
                there is evidence it was hit 
                by a Russian-supplied buk
                anti-aircraft missile - a 
                claim also denied by 
                Russia. 'Callous disregard'.</p>
            
            <p>Malaysia pushed for an 
               international tribunal to try
                those responsible. The 
                move was backed by the 
                Netherlands - which had
                196 national on board- 
                Ukraine, Belgium and 
                Australia. Moscow has 
                blamed the government in 
                Kiev for thr disaster.
                Eleven of the 15 UN 
                Security Council members 
                backed the draft resolution 
                Speaking earlier this 
                month, Russian President 
                Vladimir PuTin said that 
                the establishment of a 
                tribunal would be 
                "premature" and "counter-
                productive".</p>
